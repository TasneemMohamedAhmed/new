        <p class="quote">"Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy."</p>
        <p>"The staff seemed genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people."</p>
